Guidelines for submitting patches
====================================

Please submit any patches against this fork of meta-dpdk to the meta-xilinx
mailing list (meta-xilinx@lists.yoctoproject.org).

Regardless of how you submit a patch or patchset, the patches should
at minimum follow the suggestions outlined in the 'Submitting a Change
to the Yocto Project' section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.
Specifically, they should:

  - Include a 'Signed-off-by:' line.  A commit can't legally be pulled
    in without this.

  - Provide a single-line, short summary of the change.  This short
    description should be prefixed by the BSP or recipe name, as
    appropriate, followed by a colon.  Capitalize the first character
    of the summary (following the colon).

  - For the body of the commit message, provide detailed information
    that describes what you changed, why you made the change, and the
    approach you used.

  - If the change addresses a specific bug or issue that is associated
    with a bug-tracking ID, include a reference to that ID in your
    detailed description in the following format: [YOCTO #<bug-id>].

  - Pay attention to line length - please don't allow any particular
    line in the commit message to stretch past 72 characters.

  - For any non-trivial patch, provide information about how you
    tested the patch, and for any non-trivial or non-obvious testing
    setup, provide details of that setup.
